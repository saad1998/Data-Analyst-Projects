    "The most common genre is <b>Games</b> with <b>58.16%</b>, and the runner up here is <b>Entertainment</b> with <b>7.88%</b>. It seems that most of the apps on IOS store are designed for an entertainment purpose rather than a practical purpose. From the frequency table alone it seems that we should only focus on designing games but this doesn't indicate that these games have the largest number of users. Most popular genre according to large number of users can be found by comparing the number of installs or user reviews of a genre.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyzing Google Play Store Genre and Category frequency table\n",
    "\n",
    "In the genre frequency table the most common genre is <b>(8.449909747292418, Tools)</b> and in the categories frequency table the most common is <b>(18.907942238267147, FAMILY)</b>. After looking at the frequency tables of google play store, it seems that there are more productivity apps on the store other than games. Moreover, by looking at the frequency tables of category and genre of the Google play store dataset it seems that the compared to category, genre is more granular in terms of its division of Apps. Therefore, for further analysis we will be using the category column. We may refer to the genre column once we are done analyzing the category column.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comparison of Google and App store\n",
    "\n",
    "On the IOS store we found that there were more entertainment Apps than productivity Apps where as it was the other way around in the case of Google Play Store. This means that according to our validation strategy there is a high chance of a game ending up on both the Apps stores other than productive Apps. This also tells that the productive apps present on ios store have a permanent audience that is satisfied with those apps. Since productivity apps are more on google play store than IOS store this means that few productivity Apps earn enough to make it to the IOS store. Based on the frequency tables I would recomment an App in the entertainment industry such as games. The frequency tables tell us the genre having the most number of apps present on the store however, it doesnot tell us about the genre that has the most number of users. After analyzing the genres based on the most number of users we can reach on a conclusion of the best genre for the company.\n",

However, for an e-bbok or an audio book even a simple advertisement would help in bringing our application to the book lovers. After a risk assessment it would be best to go with the books and references idea as the risk and investment involved in this project is low with high returns..\n"
